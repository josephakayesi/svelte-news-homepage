## My process

### Built with

- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

* I learnt how to approach UI development using the Mobile-First approach. 

* I learnt how to setup SASS on Sveltekit. In addition; I refreshed my knowledge on mixins and variables.

* I learnt how to create a custom responsive navigation bar. 

### Continued development

* I want to focus on creating more delightful UIs. Adding microinteractions to elements of the UI. 

* I want to focus on creating a better responsive navigation bar that fits seamlessly with the entire UI. In this project, the navigation bar pushes elements downwards which definitely needs some improvement.
